# Snips-Spr√ºche ü•¥
A patter app for Snips.ai

## Installation

**Important:** The following instructions assume that [Snips](https://snips.gitbook.io/documentation/snips-basics) is
already configured and running on your device. [SAM](https://snips.gitbook.io/getting-started/installation) should
also already be set up and connected to your device and your account.

1. In the German [app store](https://console.snips.ai/) add the
app `Verdrehte Spr√ºche` (by BastiN; [this](https://console.snips.ai/app-editor/bundle_9P346QWA0xE)) to
your *German* assistant.

2. If you already have the same assistant on your platform, update it
(with [Sam](https://snips.gitbook.io/getting-started/installation)) with:
      ```bash
      sam update-assistant
      ```
      
   Otherwise install the assistant on the platform with [Sam](https://snips.gitbook.io/getting-started/installation)
   with the following command to choose it (if you have multiple assistants in your Snips console):
      ```bash
      sam install assistant
      ```
That's it!
